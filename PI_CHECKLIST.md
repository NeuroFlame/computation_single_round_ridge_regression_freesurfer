# **PI Approval Requirements Checklist**  

Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for defining and enforcing additional requirements specific to their computation module. In addition to the general technical requirements, PIs must ensure the following criteria are met. The following are optional but suggested requirements.  

## **Documentation**  
- [ ] PI-specific requirements are documented within the computation moduleâ€™s repository.  

## **Accuracy & Meaningfulness of Results**  
- [ ] The module produces valid and meaningful computational results.
      Replicate the COBRE Single round ridge regression Freesurfer results (152 subjects) as outlined in the vaults paper for these ROI's:
      Controls have higher values in temporal lobe: lh_S_temporal_inf_thickness, rh_S_oc_temp_lat_thickness,lh_middletemporal_thickness,lh_superiortemporal_thickness,Left_Inf_Lat_Vent

## **Compatibility with Intended Datasets**  
- [ ] The data format specification aligns with intended use cases.  
- [ ] The module has been tested against multiple dataset variations conforming to the specified format.  
- [ ] Real-world datasets have been used as examples.  

## **Dataset Validator Approval**  
- [ ] The basic dataset validator has been approved to ensure correct input data formatting.  

## **Additional PI-Specific Requirements**  
- [ ] Module-specific criteria beyond the generic requirements have been defined and documented.
